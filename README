Machine Madness

An unofficial robo rally inspired game.

The game is intended to be very expandable through being coded in a highly
procedural style (which is not the same as imperative programming).


To get a bottom-up feel for the code, read the code in this order:


game/orientation.py
game/movement.py
game/card.py
game/tile.py
